									      		<p>I am B Sai priyansh, pursuing pilot training at 2fly in Miami Florida right now I am a certified private pilot and pursuing my BBA degree  along with flying . My journgey in college was wonderful and very helpful . I have gained lot of knowledge and skills which are being very helpful for me in my present life . My journey was accompanied by RAHUL sir , he is very kind , knowledgeable , friendly there are no words to describe his presence in the college . While I was in the college he gave me many opportunities to improve my skills and overcome my fear . He guided me for choosing the right path after the junior college . He has helped me to stay confident in what I choose . He has always been friend more than a teacher with whom I could share my problems . My journey in Junior College felt homely because of Rahul sir . It is always said that with a saint the path of life gets easy , with a tourist guide a vacation becomes easy and with Rahul sir beside the educational life and path becomes easy . I'm very thankful that I was under guidance of Rahul sir .</p>
