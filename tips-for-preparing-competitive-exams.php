Regular study combined with extracurricular activities, such as group discussions, will help you thrive in these tests. One should have a defined objective and a study schedule that is well-planned. To pass interviews, one must converse with peers about current events and general knowledge.</u></p>
									<p><b>1. Make a good plan:</b> <br>Half of the job is done when you have a well-thought-out strategy. Familiarize yourself with the exam schedule you'll be taking. Calculate your time and make a study schedule.</p>
									<p><b>2. Managing Your Time</b> <br>In order to succeed, you must manage your time carefully and intelligently. Separate some time for study, relaxation, and other activities in your daily routine to minimize confusion and distractions. Make the best possible use of your time.</p>
									<p><b>3. Carefully select your subjects</b> <br>It's critical to pick a subject that you enjoy. This has been described by many students as a critical step in achieving success.</p>
									<p><b>4. Reduce the length of your research</b> <br>Stress, weariness, and even disorientation would result from studying till the last minute. Select the exam curriculum and assess your level of comfort in each part before designing your study strategy. Students should devote more time to their weak areas on a regular basis rather than all at once.</p>
									<p><b>5. Practice Papers</b> <br>It would be really beneficial to practice last year's sample papers. This will give you a sense of the exam format and force you to practice within the time constraints. Solving practice test papers can also help you improve your speed and time management.</p>
									<p><b>6. Perseverance</b> <br>Motivate yourself with the help of teachers, seniors, family members, and others. Always keep in mind that motivation will always motivate you to achieve your objectives. Furthermore, prior toppers in competitive tests should be interviewed and significant tips and instructions should be followed.</p>
